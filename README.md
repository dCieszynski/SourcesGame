#### About
Sources is a game made with Godot Engine during Go Godot Jam 2. It's my first game that i created in this game engine. It's a skill, tower defense game, where you are defending against waves of enemies. I didn't complete creating it, because of lack of time, so it misses some features, like settings, bosses etc. but it's playable and it has 14 levels to beat.
